## PacMen Factory
Exercise in loading an image for a PacMen, then making it move, and loading a different image to match when it changes direction. Click "Add PacMen" button to make more PacMen appear on screen.

This was an exercise in using JavaScript and DOM to call an image, move the image and have it detect edges and flip as need to - replacing the image with a different one to represent the Pacman turning. 

Click on the "Add PacMan" button to load a new PacMan onto the screen. When you want to start the game, click on "Start Game" button and all the PacMen will start moving, turning and changing directions.
